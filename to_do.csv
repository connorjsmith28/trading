Priority things:

investigate yfinance package and other packages. Evaluate whole process end to end and then start coding.
This guy has built something similar to what I imagine building: https://www.reddit.com/user/Jenskubi/
Models that are really bad are as useful as models that are good. Just do the opposite




Convert minute timeframes to day frames (Might just wait a few more days to get the day values)

Convert close price to range of values (up/down, big up, little up, little down, down)

Research what information is useful for making market decisions

Get 3x leverage ETF data and use that for trading once you've got a feel for basic directional trading strat

Create methodology for determining whether a model/strat is effective.
    Random start points, choose to hold/sell for given timeperiod (day,week,month), apply strategy/model and use random choice as baseline.

Features:
    midday (ask Blake about max high/low prop time of day)
    n day/weeks/months since last winning interval


Non-priority things:

combine_historical should only merge new data and not need to re-add everything

Look into creating a scheduler for auto-data pulls and later could incorporate auto-training x-times a day

Figure out how to host data on local server. That way you can run stuff when not home (raspberry pi server possibly)
