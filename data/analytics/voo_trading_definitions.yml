      To calculate an SMA, you take the sum of prices over the selected period (typically the closing price) and divide 
      that number by the number of periods. For example, to calculate a 7-day moving average, simply add up the asset's 
      closing prices over the 7 previous trading days and divide the result by 7.

      The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) is the difference between two Exponential Moving Averages. The 
      Signal line is an Exponential Moving Average of the MACD.

      The MACD signals trend changes and indicates the start of new trend direction. High values indicate overbought 
      conditions, low values indicate oversold conditions. Divergence with the price indicates an end to the current 
      trend, especially if the MACD is at extreme high or low values. When the MACD line crosses above the signal line 
      a buy signal is generated. When the MACD crosses below the signal line a sell signal is generated. To confirm the 
      signal, the MACD should be above zero for a buy, and below zero for a sell.

      The On Balance Volume (OBV) is a cumulative total of the up and down volume. When the close is higher than the 
      previous close, the volume is added to the running total, and when the close is lower than the previous close, 
      the volume is subtracted from the running total.
